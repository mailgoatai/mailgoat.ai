Why we built it:

Postal is powerful, but day-to-day workflows still felt too manual.

We wanted better ergonomics for:
- sending
- monitoring
- inbox troubleshooting
- admin workflows

- CLI for sending emails
- Admin panel for monitoring
- Inbox management + message detail
- Analytics dashboard
- MIT licensed

```
